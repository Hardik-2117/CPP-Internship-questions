C++ code with respect to usage of if(),else.......

CODE-

#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main()
{
    int age;
    cout<<"Enter your age : ";
    cin>>age;
    if (age>18)
    {
        cout<<"you are eligible to vote!!!"<<endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout<<"sorry, you are not eligible to vote!!!"<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

OUTPUT -
Enter your age - 25
you are eligible to vote!!!

Enter your age - 12
sorry, you are not eligible to vote!!!


C++ code with respect to usage of #if,#else,#endif -

CODE-

#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

int main()
{
    int age;
    cout<<"Enter your age : ";
    cin>>age;
    #if (age>18)
    {
        cout<<"you are eligible to vote!!!"<<endl;
    }
    #else
    {
        cout<<"sorry, you are not eligible to vote!!!"<<endl;
    }
    #endif
}


OUTPUT - 

Enter your age - 25
sorry, you are not eligible to vote!!!

Enter your age - 12
sorry, you are not eligible to vote!!!


So main the difference with respect to usage of if()...else.. and #if,#else and #endif are  occured in the respective output of this two code.
